1. Will need to install PyAudio and somehow make it work  
  Steps:
  a) Just downloaded the new Speech_Recognition version = 3.9.0. This time it has the Micrphone  attribute.
  b) Will still have to download pyaudio
  FINALLY FIXED THIS ERROR: Steps to follow:
  
	These steps worked on M1 Pro chips

1.) Install portaudio
brew install portaudio
2.) Link portaudio
brew link portaudio
3.) Copy the path where portaudio was installed (use it in the next step)
brew --prefix portaudio
4.)Create .pydistutils.cfg in your home directory
sudo nano $HOME/.pydistutils.cfg
5.) Then paste the following
[build_ext]
include_dirs=<PATH FROM STEP 3>/include/
library_dirs=<PATH FROM STEP 3>/lib/
6.) Install pyaudio
pip install pyaudio
or
pip3 install pyaudio
